## Technical Support

- #### I use firefox as my main browser. It is user friendly and I rarely if any have any trouble with it at all.<br />
- #### I use google on my mobile device because of its accessibility.
- #### How much technlogy has changed since 2000 such as cell phones.

- #### Billings, Montana has more businesses and motels and people now than it did in 2000.

- #### This assignment was a little easier for me because of the previous assignment so I'm getting more familiar<br /> with the file structure and the way things need to be set-up.
