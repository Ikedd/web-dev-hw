I've always liked the different designs of websites and was always interested on how they were<br>
designed. I look at websites as kind of an art form.

-  The internet is how people and Ideas are connected through technology.
-  How everything is connected through computer language.
-  How Vint and his partner even thought how to make the internet Idea happen is amazing.
