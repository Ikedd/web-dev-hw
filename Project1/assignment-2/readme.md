## Assignment 2
A version control system is like a working website timeline for developers.<br>
It helps developers keep track of there changes in there design.<br>
I believe we are using one in this class because we will consistently<br>
be making changes in this class and if we make a mistake we can always<br>
go back to an earlier version.

This assignment was different but exciting to do because I have never worked<br>
with these programs before and to see them work together is a nice reward.
