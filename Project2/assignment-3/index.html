   <h2>Directions:</h2>
<ol>

   <li> Turn out 1 piece of dough onto a lightly floured work surface. Roll into a 13-inch round, about 1/8 inch thick. Fit into 9-inch pie plate. Trim edges flush with rim. Freeze until firm, about <strong> 30 minutes. </strong></li>

   <li> Roll out remaining dough on parchment paper to a 13-inch round, about 1/8 inch thick. Transfer to a baking sheet; refrigerate until firm, about <strong> 30 minutes. </strong></li>

   <li> Preheat oven to <em>400 degrees.</em> Whisk egg yolk and cream in a small bowl; set egg wash aside. Put apples, lemon juice, granulated sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt in a large bowl; toss to combine. Fill pie shell with apple mixture, and dot with butter. Lightly brush edge of pie with a wet pastry brush. Place dough round on top of pie. Trim edges flush with rim; press to seal. To decorate:

<ul>
       <li>Crimp edges as desired.</li>
       <li> Make four 1/2-inch slits in center of pie.</li>
       <li>Brush top with egg wash; sprinkle with sanding sugar.</li>
   <li>Freeze <strong>30 minutes.</strong></li>
</ul>

   <li> Place pie on a baking sheet. Bake until crust begins to turn golden brown, about <strong> 20 minutes.</strong> Reduce oven temperature to <em>350 degrees.</em> Bake until crust is golden brown and juices are bubbling, about <strong> 35 minutes.</strong> Cover with foil if browning too quickly. Let cool completely on a rack.</li>
